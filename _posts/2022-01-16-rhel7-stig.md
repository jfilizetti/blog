title:  "Deficiency Analysis of the DoD RHEL7 STIG"

About a year and a half ago I took a class on technical writing to wrap up the requirements for my multi-decade batchelor's degree.  For that technical writing class my idea was to detail some of the problems related to cyber security in the federal government.  Since securing systems in the government space has been a significant portion of my job for most of the 21st century  I wanted to bring light to places we can improve and create more effective cyber security.   I wrote this paper on what I called deficiencies with the RHEL7 STIG.  Since this time I've tried my best to address many issues through official channels but I've officially given up trying to get DISA to embrace technical merit.  My hope is that putting this information here for others can start a wider discussion about real security rather than relying on the DISA STIG bureaucratic process. 

A link to the PDF that is roughly what I originally wrote is available [here]({{site.url}}/blog/files/2022-01-16/RHEL7_STIG_deficiencies.pdf).  However a slightly trimmed version is available below.

# Deficiency Analysis of the Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guide for Redhat Enterprise Linux 7

## Abstract
The Department of Defense spends countless hours into security configuration, assessment, and
documentation. These security configurations are often derived from Security Technical Implementation
Guides (STIGs) that are published for various hardware and software. One of the most time consuming and
problematic STIGs is related to operating systems for the Redhat Enterprise Linux system that is created by
the Defense Information Systems Agency. This STIG is of vast complexity due to the complex nature of
the operating system. As a result, there is often outdated information incorporated into this document. In
addition, many changes recommended in this STIG have far reaching effects on performance and usability.
In this report many deficiencies with the current DISA RHEL 7 STIG are investigated and approximately
40% of them require additional consideration.

## Introduction
Cyber security is the fastest growing focus area of information technology systems in the Department of
Defense. The goal of security is to provide Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability also known in the
security community as the CIA triad. To achieves these goals operating systems must continually be
evaluated as new features are integrated to ensure that the security is not compromised. In addition, security
often creates hurdles for usability and performance and therefore most operating systems are not shipped in
a “secure by default” configuration. To mitigate this problem the DoD creates Security Technical
Implementation Guides with coordination from operating system vendors to provide a security posture they
consider to be secure. In this report I plan to evaluate the STIG for the Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
operating system to determine areas that have failed to properly account for usability, performance, Denial
of Service (DoS), and other issues. This is report is based off of the latest STIG published by the Defense
Information Systems Agency Version 2 release 7 dated April 24, 2020 referenced as [1].
This report is targeted at technical evaluators and decision makers to bring attention to the numerous issues
created by the process of implementing security guidance without full understanding of the impacts. It is
often joked that the only secure system is the one that isn’t plugged in. We must strive to provide effective
use of tax payer dollars by squeezing all the performance we can get out of hardware and without hindering
our operations and maintenance staff with burdensome requirements that affect their ability to do their jobs.
I this assessment I will evaluate the following areas as it applies to the DISA STIG for RHEL 7 [1]:

- Outdated Items
- Performance Impacts
- Potential DoS
- Usability Impacts
- Other Issues

There are several areas in this report where small excerpts of source code are provided from the
RHEL/Centos 7.8 packages. These are included to provide assistance to technical staff who would like to
validate the details in this report. Each inclusion of source code will have several surrounding lines to
provide context, the line numbers, and source file identified. Also, every item detailed in this report also
details the STIG ID numbers from [1] at the end of the section. This is to provide clarity and also assistance
to any further review necessary


## Outdated Items

## Password Outdated Items
The current release for the RHEL 7 STIG [1] was released on April 24, 2020. Despite this recent release it
is still out of date with the guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Special Publication 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines [2]. There are several criteria that have been
outdated with the latest recommendations and are detailed below. These guidelines apply to human
passwords and not stored machine level passwords.
Password Expiration No Longer Recommended
According to [3] users tended to choose weaker passwords when they know password changes were
imminent in the near future. The password changes often used “common transformations such as increasing
a number in the password” [3]. The result is that security is not increased by these changes. While
recommendations for temporal password expirations are no longer recommended event-based expirations
still remain in place. Event-based password expirations are the result of some sort of breach of the
password database.

### Affected STIG IDs:
RHEL-07-010230, RHEL-07-010240, RHEL-07-010250, RHEL-07-010260

## Password Composition Rules No Longer Recommended
The current requirements in [1] specify the following password composition rules:

- At least one each of class (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols)
- No more than 3 repeating characters
- No more than 4 repeating characters in the same class

All these requirements have been removed as of [2]. The reasoning is again based on human factors. Users
tended to use predictable methods of fulfilling these requirements which minimized any security gain.
Another determined weakness of the old scheme is that these rules encouraged people to use the same
password across multiple systems. This is particularly damaging for DoD users where accounts can exist on
multiple networks. These multiple networks are very common in DoD environments where users may have
an account on unclassified, secret, and top-secret systems.

### Affected STIG IDs:
RHEL-07-010120, RHEL-07-010130, RHEL-07-010140, RHEL-07-010150, RHEL-07-010160, RHEL-07-010170,
RHEL-07-010180, RHEL-07-010190, RHEL-07-010280

## Additional Password Restrictions
The new mechanism of preventing weak passwords is to utilize a blacklist of common passwords. A
specific list of potential candidates is included below from [2]:

- Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses
- Dictionary words
- Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’).
- Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof

Password databases are included with the cracklib package that comes with the operating system. Any of
these databases of blacklisted passwords can be added to the pam_pwquality module.

## Password Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDFs)
The updated recommendation for memorized secret verifiers should use time and memory hard key
derivation functions. The only NIST evaluated algorithm that supports this requirement is Balloon [3].
This particular rule only affects one item in [1] related to PBKDFs which is for the grub2 boot loaded.
Unfortunately, there is no support in grub2 for the Balloon algorithm. Given the lack of a current technical
implementation this item should be prioritized to develop a solution.

## Mount Options for /dev/shm
The temporary file system used for shared-memory applications is setup by the system init process,
systemd. Several STID IDs require this file system to be mounted with the nodev and nosuid options.
However, these options are already defined in the source code for systemd used by the operating system.
The specific lines are highlighted below:
Note: Some white-space has been trimmed from the following source code for readability.

```C
Source file: systemd-219/src/core/mount-setup.c
 76 static const MountPoint mount_table[] = {
 77 { "sysfs", "/sys", "sysfs", NULL, MS_NOSUID|MS_NOEXEC|MS_NODEV,
 78   NULL,   MNT_FATAL|MNT_IN_CONTAINER },
 79 { "proc", "/proc", "proc", NULL,  MS_NOSUID|MS_NOEXEC|MS_NODEV,
 80   NULL,          MNT_FATAL|MNT_IN_CONTAINER },
 81 { "devtmpfs","/dev", "devtmpfs", "mode=755", MS_NOSUID|MS_STRICTATIME,
 82   NULL,          MNT_FATAL|MNT_IN_CONTAINER },
 83 { "securityfs", "/sys/kernel/security", "securityfs", NULL, MS_NOSUID|MS_NOEXEC|MS_NODEV,
 84   NULL,          MNT_NONE                   },
 85 #ifdef HAVE_SMACK
 86 { "smackfs", "/sys/fs/smackfs", "smackfs", "smackfsdef=*", MS_NOSUID|MS_NOEXEC|MS_NODEV,
 87   mac_smack_use, MNT_FATAL                  },
 88 { "tmpfs", "/dev/shm", "tmpfs","mode=1777,smackfsroot=*", MS_NOSUID|MS_NODEV|MS_STRICTATIME,
 89   mac_smack_use, MNT_FATAL                  },
 90 #endif
 91 { "tmpfs", "/dev/shm", "tmpfs","mode=1777", MS_NOSUID|MS_NODEV|MS_STRICTATIME,
```

### Affected STIG IDs:
RHEL-07-021022, RHEL-07-021023

## Disable Promiscuous Mode
The current recommendation to disable promiscuous mode is unnecessary as enabling it through the init
scripts has been deprecated in RHEL 7 as detailed in [4].

### Affected STIG ID: RHEL-07-040670


## Performance Impacts

## Auditing Performance
Auditing accounts for 71 of the 248 STIG items in [1]. Given the large footprint there should be some
significant research into the impact of auditing on performance. However, there is minimal information to
document the impact but the most comprehensive appears to be [5] from 2015 and [6] from 2018. [5]
discussed the impact of audit overhead based on the frequency of audit events per second and is captured in
Figure 1. [6] details the overhead of common programs and breaks down the performance by area of the
audit system. Figure 2 details their findings

![Auding Overhead]({{site.url}}/blog/files/2022-01-16/auditing_overhead_progs.png)

Figure 2 Audit Overhead by Program Source: [6]


It is clear from both figures that auditing can add unacceptable overhead. In Figure 2 the overhead added by
the kernel is minimal but the Netlink socket used to flush data to the audit daemon, and the audit daemon
overhead itself is significant for various programs. Especially affected are programs like Firefox and
Apache that generate many audit records. Further analysis should be conducted to determine how auditing
performance affects scalability of a single system.

## Firewall Performance
The firewall functionality of RHEL is implemented using iptables. There have been numerous performance
issues identified in iptables and so careful attention must be paid to the number of rules used. However, [1]
requires “that the firewall must be configured to “system access control program must be configured to
grant or deny system access to specific hosts and services”. As hardware continues to grow in capability it
can support more and more services. As the number of services supported from a single machine grows so
will the to enforce these requirements. Figure 3 shows the impact on throughput as the number of rules
increase while Figure 4 details the impact on throughput of supporting more ports. The purple line in these
graphs represent iptables used by RHEL 7.

## Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Changes
There are several recommendations from [1] that open possible avenues of DoS.

## Login DoS
[1] requires that accounts be locked out for a minimum of 15 minutes after three unsuccessful logon
attempts within a 15-minute timeframe. Given the weakened security posture from using outdated
password guidelines may be some justification for this rule but this setting opens user accounts to a simple
DoS. Furthermore, this rule ultimately compromises availability of the CIA triad. The PCI-DSS standard
[7] requires a user id to be locked out after no more than 6 attempts. The PCI-DSS standard seems more
reasonable of a balance between confidentiality and availability.
Another rule from [1] requires the root (superuser) account to also be locked out for 15 minutes after three
unsuccessful logon attempts within a 15-minute time frame. This policy creates the possibility of a DoS to
all system users with no ability to resolve it from within since only a superuser can unlock accounts.

Rather than lockout the root account, the pam_securetty module can be used to limit access to a console
through out-of-band access using a Backplane Management Console (BMC) or Integrated Lights Out (ILO).
With this additional security measure, the root account could be exempted from account lock out while still
preserving security.

### Affected STIG ID:
RHEL-07-010320, RHEL-07-010330, RHEL-07-010430, RHEL-07-040670

## System DoS
There are several requirements in [1] that require home directories, /var, and /tmp file systems to all exist on
separation partitions. The justification for this requirement is that it could protect the system if the partition
“became full or failed”. The failure of the /var or /tmp file systems would prevent many system level
daemons from functioning properly. Failures in /home would only cause user access DoS. However, these
fail to account for the impact to system performance as a disk is partitioned up. On Solid State Devices
(SSDs) there is no significant impact, but when utilizing Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) the impact can be
dramatic. HDDs only support approximately 100-150 Input Output Operations (IOPs) per second where
SSDs tend to support around 4000+ IOPS. When disks are partitioned many data transfers that could have
been merged into a single IOP can no longer be merged due to their non-contiguous nature. The result is
that a system disk can become saturated causing multiple second delays in responsiveness. Therefore, this
recommendation should be considered only when the partitions are on SSDs or separate HDDs.

### Affected STIG ID:
RHEL-07-021310, RHEL-07-021320, RHEL-07-021340

## Other Items
There are several rules from [1] that are inaccurate in their justification and therefore should be corrected or
removed.

## Removing System Accounts
[1] states that “If the accounts on the system do not match the provided documentation, or accounts that do
not support an authorized system function are present, this is a finding”. The recommendation is to remove
several system accounts. However, these accounts come suitably protected by providing an unusable login
shell and having a locked password. Therefore, there is no risk of unauthorized use of these accounts. In
addition, these conflict with vendor guidance in [5] that states:
It is recommended to keep UIDs/GIDs of the system service accounts as default. The UIDs/GIDs of
some system service accounts are hard-coded in the application itself, changing the uids/gids may
potentially break the functionality of an application.
These accounts exist for compliance with the Linux Standard Base [9].

### Affected STIG ID:
RHEL-07-020270

## Interactive Users Must Have Home Directory in /etc/passwd
The discussion in [1] states that “This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to
access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would
not be able to access”. The first part of the statement is true but there is no risk of visibility into system files
they would not normally have. This is because the Linux Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is still in
use. As can be seen below from the login source code that if changing directory to the user’s home
directory fails then the “/” directory is used:

```C
util-linux-2.23.2/login-utils/login.c
1330         /* wait until here to change directory! */
1331         if (chdir(pwd->pw_dir) < 0) {
1332                 warn(_("%s: change directory failed"), pwd->pw_dir);
1333 
1334                 if (!getlogindefs_bool("DEFAULT_HOME", 1))
1335                         exit(0);
1336                 if (chdir("/"))
1337                         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
1338                 pwd->pw_dir = "/";
1339                 printf(_("Logging in with home = \"/\".\n"));
1340         }
```

Also, relevant is the DEFAULT_HOME attribute can be set to “no” in the /etc/login.defs file to prevent
login in the event that the user’s home directory is inaccessible.

## Usability Items
## Impact on Usability
Security must be a balance between the impact on performance and usability. Different groups have
different numbers of personnel to be able to operate and maintain their systems and so a discussion is
necessary about the STIG rules that impact efficient system administration. Efficient administration is the
ability for a small number of administrators to operate and maintain a large number of systems. The
following items detail various STIG rules and their impact on efficient administration.
Delay between failed login attempts

[1] requires the addition of a 4 second delay be added to the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
configuration for pam_faillock. This restriction however, ignores the fact that configuration provided by the
vendor already provides a two second delay on failure on local password failures through the pam_unix
module. The following source code section captures the respective section for pam_unix and highlights the
fail delay setting.

```C
Linux-PAM-1.1.8/modules/pam_unix/support.c
 721 int _unix_verify_password(pam_handle_t * pamh, const char *name
 722                           ,const char *p, unsigned int ctrl)
 723 {
 724         struct passwd *pwd = NULL;
 725         char *salt = NULL;
 726         char *data_name;
 727         int retval;
 728 
 729 
 730         D(("called"));
 731 
 732 #ifdef HAVE_PAM_FAIL_DELAY
 733         if (off(UNIX_NODELAY, ctrl)) {
 734                 D(("setting delay"));
 735                 (void) pam_fail_delay(pamh, 2000000);   /* 2 sec delay for on failure */
```

This setting combined with the idle connection closing only creates a nuisance for users and administrators
logging into the system and has a negligible impact on security. To capture the additional security, see the
following two approximate equations where the values are represented by the following:

900 is the number of seconds an account is locked after 3 failures

3 failures before an account is locked

1000 attempts to guess the password

6 is the number of seconds with the pam_faildelay requirement

2 is the number of seconds removing the pam_faildelay requirement

**time no fail delay=((1000/3)\*900)+((1000/3)\*2)=300366 seconds or 3.476 days**

**time with fail delay=((1000/3\*900)+((1000/3)\*6)=301698 seconds or 3.49 days**

The addition of the failure delay is clearly insubstantial and therefore should be removed from the
requirements.

RHEL-07-010430

## Remote privileged user access without password prompts
There are number of tools developed by High Performance Computing (HPC) administrators to effectively
administer a large number of systems efficiently. These tools are often developed based on the need to
administer thousands of systems by a small administration team. Two of the most common of these tools
are Parallel Distributed Shell (pdsh) and Clustered Shell (clush). These tools work by opening secure shell
connections to each server and running a command across hundreds of thousands of servers in just seconds.
In order to make administrative changes efficiently administrators must be able to login as root (the
superuser) or have the ability to run commands with superuser privileges using su or sudo. [1] requires that
both remote root logins be disabled and su/sudo be disabled without a password. Preventing direct access to
the root account is a considered a good security practice. This prevents users from logging in directly as a
user other than their own and preserving non-repudiation. However, additional security restrictions can be
added to restrict su/sudo to only users of a specific group. Using these productions allow privileged
escalation while maintaining non-repudiation and increased security. To make these changes the su
command can be restricted to the wheel group by adding highlighted line to /etc/pam.d/su.


```
#%PAM-1.0
auth		sufficient	pam_rootok.so
auth		required	pam_wheel.so use_uid group=wheel
auth		substack	system-auth
auth		include		postlogin
account		sufficient	pam_succeed_if.so uid = 0 use_uid quiet
account		include		system-auth
password	include		system-auth
session		include		system-auth
session		include		postlogin
session		optional	pam_xauth.so
```

Restricting sudo access to the wheel group can be done by adding the following to the /etc/sudoers file.

```
%wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
```

# Conclusion

## Summary of findings
There are many issues identified in this report which should cause alterations of the DISA RHEL 7 STIG.
To highlight the percentages of issues we have discussed here the following chart shows the percentage of
those issues based on the 248 Rules in [1]. It is clear here that much consideration needs to be addressed to
ensure that the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are evaluated in a balanced manner. It appears as
though the Availability portion of the three is not adequately being considered in many of the STIG rules
identified here. Figure 5 captures the percentage of issues and acceptable rules identified in [1].

## Recommendations
Based on the findings from source code reviews, updated guidance, and the various performance issues the
following actions are recommended for updating the DISA RHEL 7 STIG:
1. Update all outdated password rules
2. Develop a memory and time hard PBKDF implementation (Balloon) for the GRUB2 bootloader
3. Develop a tool to monitor performance impacts of compliant auditing
4. Develop a tool to monitor performance impacts of compliant firewall rules
5. Utilize provided information for DoS issues to fix STIG rules
6. Remove the password fail delay requirement
7. Allow documented exceptions for privileged escalation without password for admin groups utilizing
the documented security enhancements here
